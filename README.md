  ## Lesson 1: Genome Alignment
  * 2023-04-10 
  > Alignment of Sars-Cov2 genome: egypt/nrc-01 and Variant calling
  
  > In this session, participants will delve into the intricacies of genome alignment with a focus on the Sars-Cov2 genome (Egypt/NRC-01) and variant calling. Utilizing raw data in FASTA format obtained from the NCBI SRA database, participants will gain proficiency in samtools application and alignment based on indexing.

  ## Lesson 3: Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm for Motif Study 
  * 2023-05-15
  > Finding motif by commonly used EM algorithm
  
  > Participants will delve into the EM algorithm, a widely employed tool in motif finding for sequencing data analysis. Understanding the composition of the EM algorithm in the context of various sequencing algorithms, participants will interpret the significance of each process and validate the results.

  ## Lesson 4: Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
  * 2023-05-22
  > Gene function in term and it's abundance on leishmaniasis 
  
  > Diverging from conventional analyses, this session emphasizes functional expression in gene ontology (term) networks and pathway analysis for leishmaniasis. Participants will engage in quantitative analysis with a focus on gene function and its abundance.
